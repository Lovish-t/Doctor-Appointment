# Doctor Appointment Booking Website

This is a simple website where users can book appointments with doctors. It is made using the MERN stack which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## What I used
- React for frontend
- Node.js and Express for backend
- MongoDB for database

## What it can do
- Users can sign up and log in
- They can book appointments with doctors
- Doctors can see and manage their appointments
- Admin can manage users and doctors

## How to run it

1. First, clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/MohamedBoukthir/Doctor-Appointment-Booking-MERN-Stack.git
